About the project (in short):
It's related to an online shooter game, Escape From Tarkov.
It will list in-game item prices, showing both auction house prices and fixed vendor prices, along with when those vendors are available. 
If an item is craftable, it would calculate the required materials and compare the total crafting cost to the purchase price. 
It would also rank armors and weapons based on price-to-value ratio. For weapons, it would generate permutations based on part configurations and rank them according to specific attributes.
